            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>
               In this project we were 3 people and we were all game designers.
               <br>
               One of them focused more on the documentation, another on the animations and I focused on the development.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The player has a movement set, some of them can be enhanced or unlocked when using their sword.
                Because of the possibilities of these moves (conditions, transitions, combos, context, ...) 
                I had to plan a robust system where planned moves could be defined in Blueprints and 
                future movements and tweaks/patchs could be implemented without slow iterations.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h1>Tech solution for modular movements</h1>
            <p>
                The solution that rolled out quite well for us was a mix of State Trees, Blueprint definitions and fragments.
                <br>
                <b>State Trees</b> were used as the authority for managing the states of the Player and the Sword (one for each).
                This comes really handy to control transitions between states, especially when you have runtime conditions that needs to be executed.
                <br>
                <b>Blueprints</b> definitions were used to define a Player/Sword movement (one BP per move).
                Those Blueprint are then referenced in the State Tree to be instantiated at runtime.
                <br>
                And finally in these Blueprints <b>fragments</b> were used to allow modular moves. Which is great for iterating and avoid hardcoded situations.
            </p>
            <br>

            <br>
            <p>
                It may be at first annoying to have to work with a dozens of Blueprints to have a few moves, but it was mandatory for fast iterations with source control.
                <br>
                If the moves and the parameters were on the State Tree tasks, anytime someone wanted to work on a move, no one could work as the whole State Tree asset would of been checked out.
                <br>
                With multiple Blueprints, each designer can work on a set of moves without bothering others.
            </p>

            <h1>Player Movements</h1>
            <p>
                For the player movements, fragments are the main source of behaviors.
                <br>
                A few example of fragments are:
                <br>
                - Editing the player speed
                <br>
                - Changing camera properties
                <br>
                - Sending a State Tree event to the sword State Tree
                <br>
                - Playing anim montages
                <br>
                - Running external Blueprints called "Scripts", mainly used for more game feel effects like camera shakes or flow logic like switching to another player move/state
                <br>
                - Changing gravity, locking moving direction and more
            </p>

            <h1>Sword Movements</h1>
            <p>
                The sword moves using physics. For custom contextual actions such as the sword dash we use sequencers.
                <br>
                Sword movements have similarities with the player movement system, but they are quite different.
                <br>
                First off, the Sword Movement Component can run 2 types of sword movements at the same time: a Movement Behavior and a Rotation Behavior.
                Sometimes a sword move will have both needed and in rare cases only one of them will be running.
                <br>
                These sword movements Blueprints are based on a mix of fragments and subclasses.
                
                <br>
                - example of subclasses
                - player event container
                - transitions
                - sequencer events
                - hand by hand between sword and player for special moves
            </p>
